### 🚨 **Troubleshooting for Demo Day**

#### **If Backend Stops Working**:
1. Restart: `cd "c:\Learning\Carbon Sense AI\carbonsense-demo\backend"; python app.py`
2. Check if port 5000 is blocked
3. Use backup screenshots in README.md

#### **If Dashboard Doesn't Load**:
1. Refresh the browser
2. Check network connectivity to localhost:5000
3. Open index.html directly in browser

#### **If Real-time Data Stops**:
1. Click anywhere on the dashboard to trigger updates
2. Refresh the page to restart WebSocket connection
3. Demo still works with static data

### 💡 **Pro Tips for Maximum Impact**
